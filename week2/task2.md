# **TASK 2: Image Deblurring Using U-Net architecture**

- **Objective:** The objective of this task is to develop a deep learning model to perform image deblurring and denoising using the UNet architecture. The provided dataset consists of triplets of images for each scene: sharp, defocused-blurred, and motion-blurred images. The model should be capable of taking a blurred image as input and generating a high-quality, sharp, and noise-free image as output.

- **PS:** The performance of the model will be evaluated based on the L2 norm distance between the predicted sharp image and the ground truth sharp image on both the training and test sets. Build and train a UNet-based model to deblur and denoise the defocused-blurred and motion-blurred images, aiming to restore them to their corresponding sharp versions. Submission should be only in **PyTorch** framework.

- **Deadline:** As the secy tasks have been released, deadline for this task is **25th May EOD**.
