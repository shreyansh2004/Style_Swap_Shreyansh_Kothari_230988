# style-swap

- This is the official repository for the BCS Summer Project 2024-25 - Style Swap
- Discord will be our primary means of communication, join the bcs [server](https://discord.gg/zZQbZcu29f)
- Mentors of the project :
1. [Sagar Arora](https://github.com/qu-bit1) (qu.bit)
2. [Aditya Prakash](https://github.com/Aditya-Prakash04) (adi_tyaprakash)

- You can read the Project Proposal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhiIiguL7nwavbcgN1AwvRUS4OU4ErK8/view?usp=sharing)

- This project aims to introduce mentees to the Vision side of Machine learning with a hint of Generative AI i.e Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) by training a GAN–inversion based model for text–conditioned fashion image editing, which can be used with a wide variety of textual inputs and leads to realistic and visually convincing editing results by exploring techniques like special regularization techniques for the GAN inversion procedure to minimize the generation of images outside the GAN learned distribution.
- We'll follow the [FICE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02110) paper for the project.

## Tentative timeline - 6 weeks

- Week 1 - CNNs theory
- Week 2 - ML frameworks (tf/torch)
- Week 3 - GANs in detail
- Week 4 - Text to image generation
- Week 5 - Understanding the FICE paper
- Week 6-7 - Implementing the FICE paper
- Week 8 - Fine tuning, Results analysis, Improvements
